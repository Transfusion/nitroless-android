# Nitroless for Android

Android app for the defunct [Nitroless](https://web.archive.org/web/20211207190002/https://github.com/Nitroless) project; a custom keyboard where you can search through "repositories" of emotes that you've added.

The two included emote repos are collections of static files [hosted on GH pages here](https://github.com/Transfusion/nitroless-old-emotes), so the app will continue to work for the foreseeable future.
